**Assignment 01**
Instructions:

Choose a Dataset 📁:
Select a dataset from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Data Loading and Cleaning 🧹:

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Clean the data by handling any missing values.
String Manipulation 🔤:

Use string manipulation techniques to clean any text columns (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing extra spaces).
Use NumPy ➗:

Convert relevant data columns to NumPy arrays and perform basic statistics (mean, median).
Data Splitting 🔀:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn.
Build a Model 🏗️:

Select a simple machine learning model (like linear regression).
Train and evaluate the model using the training and testing sets.
Report 📄:

Write a short report (1-2 pages) summarizing your analysis and results.

**assignment 02**
Objective:
Analyze a customer dataset to predict churn using Scikit-learn, data splitting, and data aggregation techniques. 📊

Tasks:
Data Aggregation: 📈

Load a customer dataset (you can create a sample).
Use Pandas to aggregate the data to find the average age and tenure of customers who churned versus those who didn’t.
Data Splitting: 🔍

Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
Use Scikit-learn's train_test_split to divide the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
Model Training: 🧠

Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression).
Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set using accuracy.
